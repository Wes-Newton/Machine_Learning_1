This is examples and code snippets and other material based upon the Coursera course Machine Learning
by Andrew Ng.  The bulk of the conversion from Matlab/Octave is from Johnwittenauer.net.
There was no poing in re-inventing.  In some cases my code may be substituted.  I generally
added some code to view the resulting model in a bit more detail.
