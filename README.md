This is examples and code snippets and other material based upon the Coursera course Machine Learning
by Andrew Ng.  The bulk of the math conversion from Matlab/Octave is from Johnwittenauer.net.
There was no point in re-inventing.  In some cases my code may be substituted.  The plotting routines 
were added to show the models, decisions boundaries, or predictions.  It most cases the relevant
routines from Sci-Kit learn were added.  Exercise 5 was not covered at Johnwittenanuer.net that I found.
